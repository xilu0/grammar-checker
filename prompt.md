# /specify
develop a Single-Page Application (SPA) that can help me practice English grammar. The application should be structured as a series of slides. The content should cover all grammatical knowledge points, progressing from simple to complex. For each grammar point, provide:
A clear and easy-to-understand explanation.
A simple example sentence.
A complex example sentence.

# /plan
The application uses Angular. Use official components, vanilla HTML, CSS, and TypeScript as much as possible. the application does not depend on the backend, and the english grammar knowledge content is stored in a local json file 


Now I want you to go and audit the implementation plan and the implementation detail files.
Read through it with an eye on determining whether or not there is a sequence of tasks that you need
to be doing that are obvious from reading this. Because I don't know if there's enough here. For example,
when I look at the core implementation, it would be useful to reference the appropriate places in the implementation
details where it can find the information as it walks through each step in the core implementation or in the refinement.
