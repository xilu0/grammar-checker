# /specify
develop a Single-Page Application (SPA) that can help me practice English grammar. The application should be structured as a series of slides. The content should cover all grammatical knowledge points, progressing from simple to complex. For each grammar point, provide:
A clear and easy-to-understand explanation.
A simple example sentence.
A complex example sentence.

# /plan
The application uses Angular. Use official components, vanilla HTML, CSS, and TypeScript as much as possible. the application does not depend on the backend, and the english grammar knowledge content is stored in a local json file
