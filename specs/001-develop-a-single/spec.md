# Feature Specification: English Grammar Practice SPA

**Feature Branch**: `001-develop-a-single`  
**Created**: 2025-09-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "develop a Single-Page Application (SPA) that can help me practice English grammar. The application should be structured as a series of slides. The content should cover all grammatical knowledge points, progressing from simple to complex. For each grammar point, provide: A clear and easy-to-understand explanation. A simple example sentence. A complex example sentence."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to learn English grammar through a series of slides, so that I can improve my grammar skills from basic to advanced levels.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the application's home screen, **When** I start a lesson, **Then** I should see the first grammar slide.
2. **Given** I am viewing a grammar slide, **When** I navigate to the next slide, **Then** I should see the next grammar point.
3. **Given** I am viewing a grammar slide for a specific point, **Then** I should see a clear explanation, a simple example, and a complex example.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user reaches the end of the grammar slides? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should it loop, show a summary, or something else?]
- How does the system handle users who want to jump to a specific grammar point? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is a table of contents or search functionality required?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST present grammar lessons as a Single-Page Application (SPA).
- **FR-002**: The application MUST be structured as a series of slides.
- **FR-003**: The content MUST cover all grammatical knowledge points. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the definitive source for "all" grammatical knowledge points?]
- **FR-004**: The grammar points MUST be ordered from simple to complex. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the specific progression of topics?]
- **FR-005**: Each grammar point MUST have a clear and easy-to-understand explanation.
- **FR-006**: Each grammar point MUST have a simple example sentence.
- **FR-007**: Each grammar point MUST have a complex example sentence.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST allow users to navigate between slides.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **GrammarPoint**: Represents a single grammatical concept. Key attributes include a title, a clear explanation, a simple example sentence, a complex example sentence, and its order in the curriculum.
- **Slide**: Represents the visual presentation of a single `GrammarPoint`.
